#selfStudy_CSAPP

This original project was downloaded from github.com/Maecenas

Due to software restriction, 
the lab1 and lab2 had to be done inside the virtual box 
Ubuntu(Linux distribution, sorry just notes for myself) vm envrionment.

The latest MacOS no longer supports 32-bit envrionment, 
lab1 cannot compile as the result.

lab2 is based on ELF(Executable and Linkable Format) which supports by 
Linux envrionment but not Mach(which uses Mach-O).

#lab quick run through:

lab0 - implement basic c function for altering a linked list

lab1 - practice on bitwise operations

lab2 - practice on gdb debugger
